    <h1>Epicodus Animal Shelter</h1> 
    <h2>Puck</h2>
    <p> I'm Puck, and I'm a Very Good Boy. Like everyone, I have some quirks but that just makes me more interesting. 
        When we meet, it will take me a little while to get comfortable with you - but here's a hint - bring treats and before 
        long I'll show you a trick and shake your hand! At about four years old, I'm very handsome with my brindle coat and floppy 
        expressive ears. Based on my body shape, I'm a fast runner with quick reflexes and I love to hunt for small critters outside.

    <h2>Bubba</h2>
    <p> Meet Bubba, an absolute fan favorite amongst shelter staff and volunteers! This poor guy has been through the ringer, 
        but we just know his happy ending is out there! He first arrived at our shelter in 2015 after being found lost near Gasworks park. 
        At the time he was an exuberant teenager, all waggy tails and eager to play. Though his owners were located, one year later, 
        he was again found on the street and this time surrendered permanently. When he was adopted, we thought that would be his forever home. 
        Alas in August 2020 he was surrendered because of a change in living situation. His third time back, he was no longer the happy-go-lucky pup, 
        but can you blame in? Bubba had developed reactivity; he was anxious in his kennel and easily startled by other animals or people.

    <h2>Madron</h2>
    <p> Madrona is a sweet, talkative boy looking for his forever home. He loves using his scratching posts, getting pets, and asking for treats. 
        But don't let his cuteness fool you: he's mastered the art of cabinet-opening and will help himself to a midnight snack when you're not looking. 
        Madrona can be shy around strangers at first - but once he feels comfortable with you, he won't leave your side. He would do best in a calm, quiet 
        home with no dogs or young children, as he's not a fan of loud noises or being held. Eventually, he'll let you pet his belly, which makes him one 
        of those magical cats you've heard about in stories but have never met... yet!
